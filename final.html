			<h3>Explore the stunning city of Leon</h3>
			<p>The original city of Leon was established by Spanish conqueror Francisco Hernández de Córdoba in 1523 at the foot of the Momotombo volcano. Unfortunately the volcano exploded in 1610 causing the city to become damaged beyond repair and subsequently abandoned. A new city was established in Leon's current location with the official name of Santiago de los Caballeros de Leon – though the long form of this name is seldom used today. The ruins of old Leon – Leon Viejo – still lie at the foot of Momotombo and make for a fascinating tour. </p>

			<h3>Explore the wonders of Bluefields</h3>
			<p>According to legend, Bluefields is named after the Dutch pirate ‘Blauwveldt' who was the first to settle in the area. In the 16th and 17th century it served as a rendezvous point for English and Dutch buccaneers and it soon became a port with some prominence. 1678 saw it becoming the capital of the British protectorate over the Mosquito Coast. Unfortunately, much of the progress made in this little sea port was destroyed along with the town in 1988, but it has been somewhat rebuilt and the current town of Bluefields is an odd mixture of past British colonial buildings, west Indian cottages and Louisiana plantation influences. Most of the inhabitants are English-speaking, but there is occasional interaction with Indians from the Miskito, Sumu and Rama tribes that share the coast. </p>
